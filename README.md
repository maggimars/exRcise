# exRcise

Generate and run a workout in R. :muscle:

```
git clone https://github.com/shu251/exRcise.git
cd exRcise
```

Launch and run in R (RStudio is best). Provided ```workout-list.txt``` comes with many different warm-up and main exercises.   


### How to get swole with R

1. Run the ```generate_workout()``` function, which randomly selects a desired number of warm-up and main exercises. Output is a data frame with a list of exercises.
2. Execute ```run_workout()```, specify how long you want the main exercises to be run (intervals :hourglass_flowing_sand:) in seconds. Workout will run in R console with a countdown of 10 seconds (transitions). Warm-ups default to 30 seconds each. :sound: Turn the volume up!
3. Go wild and generate and run a tabata workout. 
4. Hydrate. :potable_water:
